# Photo Search App
A simple React application created for educational purposes that allows you to search and sort photos using the Flickr photo hosting API.  

The Main page contains a search field, sorting, a block with search results, and pagination. A detailed description of a photo opens on a separate page.  
The Form page contains a registration form created to demonstrate validation. After clicking the "Submit" button, all data from the form is displayed below the form in the form of "Cards". Entered but not yet submitted data is saved when navigating to other pages. Validation occurs after clicking the "Submit" button and with each field change if there are errors.
